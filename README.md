#### Dependencies:
You need `jq` Version 1.6 or above, and `gawk` installed in order for coinTrack to work.  
You also might need a free API Key form Cryptocompare (https://min-api.cryptocompare.com/), but it seems to work without it at the moment.

#### How to Install:
  - You only need one File: coinTrack.sh
  - Best to copy file into a own Folder
  - give the file necessary permissions `sudo chmod +x coinTrack.sh`
  - Start with `./coinTrack.sh`

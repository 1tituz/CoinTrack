#### Dependencies:
Make sure to install `jq` Version 1.7.1 and above, and `gawk` in order for coinTrak to work.  
You also might need a free API Key form Cryptocompare (https://min-api.cryptocompare.com/), but it seems to work without it at the moment.

#### How to Install:
  - Download: coinTrack_v0.4.sh (latest Version)
  - Best to copy file into a own Folder
  - give the file necessary permissions `sudo chmod +x coinTrack_v0.4.sh`
  - Start with `./coinTrack_v0.4.sh`
